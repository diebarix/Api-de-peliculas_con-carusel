# Api of movies with carusel and scroll infinite

This app is about the movies, I use the API of MovieDB, basically show the movies poster and his titles actual, apart on the top side is the carusel, for the carusel i use glider.js, show the 10 first movies with bottons to change the movies.

The app too have scroll infinite, as you scroll and reach the end of the first 20 movies, new movies will appear, this is thanks to intersection observer.
